        <h1>Why is Health Insurance Necessary?</h1>
        <p>Below are some reasons why health insurance is important:</p>
           <h3>Financial protection</h3>
           <p>Health insurance offers financial security against medical expenses, such as hospitalisation, surgeries, medications, ambulance expenses and other healthcare services. It helps you cover these costs without having to use your savings or take on any debt.</p>
           <h3>Emergency situations</h3>
           <p>Emergencies such as accidents or sudden illnesses can occur unexpectedly and lead to substantial medical expenses.   Health insurance provides crucial financial support during such emergencies. With health insurance, you can access timely   medical attention without worrying about the financial implications.</p>
           <h3>Safeguard your family</h3>
           <p>The insurance safeguards your family by ensuring that your loved ones have access to comprehensive medical coverage at   all times. Health insurance provides reassurance and promotes their well-being and overall quality of life.</p>
           <h3>Healthcare costs are rising fast</h3>
           <p>The rate at which medical costs are rising makes it necessary to have health insurance. Medical trend rate, i.e. the   increase in per-person cost due to medical inflation is expected to rise at double the inflation rate in India itself. The   forecasted medical trend rate will be 10% in India, while inflation will be at 5%~. Cancer and diseases of the circulatory   system remain the top two highest claims reported by most insurers, followed by gastrointestinal diseases and respiratory   conditions. With a fixed benefit health insurance cover, you can effectively fight critical illnesses like cancer and   conditions related to the heart.</p>
           <h3>Critical illness coverage</h3>
           <p>The costs associated with treating critical illnesses are notably high. Health insurance policies with a critical   illness cover offer financial protection against critical illnesses, such as cancer, heart diseases, kidney ailments, organ  transplants and other life-threatening illnesses. This can be used to cover expenses such as chemotherapy, radiation   therapy, hospitalisation, surgeries, medications, rehabilitation and more.</p><hr>
           <h1>Types Of Health Insurance Policies</h1>
           <p>There are basically two kinds of health insurance policies such as individual or self-plan and family floater policy. As the name suggests, individual policy would only provide coverage and benefits to the main policyholder. On the other hand, in case of a family floater plan, there is only one plan which provides coverage to your entire family such as spouse, dependent children, parent and parent-in-laws or dependent siblings. <br>

           One should select the plan, depending upon the factors such as your age, family medical history, children’s age, medical history and of course one’s budget.  Let’s understand about each of these plans in detail:</p>

           <h3>Individual or Self Health Insurance Plan</h3>

           <p>An individual health insurance policy is issued under the name of a single policyholder, which means that the sum insured coverage and the benefits of the policy is totally dedicated to the insured and covers no one else. Here, the individual purchases the policy to maintain their own health which in turn provides financial help in case of their own medical emergency.</p>

           <h3>Family Floater Health Insurance Plan</h3>

           <p>Family floater health insurance is one policy which aims to provide sum insured coverage to individual and as well his family members. Rather than taking a single policy for each member of the family, the family health insurance plan is a better option, as it acts as an umbrella for the entire family. Here the sum assured coverage is shared by all the members who have been covered under the same plan.</p>

           <p>However, it is advisable to have a separate plan for your senior citizen parent or parent-in-laws as it will prove to be a more affordable option. Similarly, if any member in the family has a huge medical history, then it is also better to buy a separate plan for them rather than covering them in the family floater plan.</p>
